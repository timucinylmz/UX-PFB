# UI for allowing users to submit PayForBlob Transactions on Celestia's Blockspace Race Testnet

## Explanation

This web app is developed by me for Blockspace Race testnet's bonus task which is organised by Celestia. You can reach the app via your browser which has address http://128.140.9.56/

Description:

Create a UI for allowing users to submit PayForBlob Transactions. You can check out the Node tutorial (https://docs.celestia.org/developers/node-tutorial/). It shows you how you can call the API in order to submit a PFB transaction (https://docs.celestia.org/developers/node-tutorial/#submit-a-pfb-transaction) , and how to retrieve the data (https://docs.celestia.org/developers/node-tutorial/#get-namespaced-shares-by-block-height) by block height and namespace.
