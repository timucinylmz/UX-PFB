This web app is developed by me for Blockspace Race testnet's bonus task which is organised by Celestia.

Description:

Create a UI for allowing users to submit PayForBlob Transactions. You can check out the Node tutorial (https://docs.celestia.org/developers/node-tutorial/). It shows you how you can call the API in order to submit a PFB transaction (https://docs.celestia.org/developers/node-tutorial/#submit-a-pfb-transaction) , and how to retrieve the data (https://docs.celestia.org/developers/node-tutorial/#get-namespaced-shares-by-block-height) by block height and namespace.

Directions:

Submission is limited to only 1, do not submit more than one.
Create a UI for submitting a PFB transaction.
Ensure it is open source and share the Github repository as well. UI for submitting PayForBlob transactions.
